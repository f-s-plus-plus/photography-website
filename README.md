# Photography Blog (Website)
A personal website that uses PHP 7 for the backend that allows the user to upload images. It allows for sharing those aforementioned images. The basic features are done, but I will continue to update it as I see fit. Bootstrap was used for the modals, buttons, forms, and the navbar and both jQuery and vanilla JavaScript as well.
